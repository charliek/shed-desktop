//! shed-app — the display-free app-logic layer shared by the shed clients: the
//! shed-core-backed [`Backend`] (one HTTP client per configured host + the
//! pull-based create store), with no UI or env-prefix coupling. The GTK + Tauri
//! clients (and later the Swift app via the FFI) each build it from their own
//! `SHED_*_` env via [`Backend::from_env_parts`]. Depends only on the pure
//! `shed-core` protocol crate — this is where the per-client app logic that was
//! Swift-only (poller, df/images, the reachability rollup) will also land (A1a-add).
