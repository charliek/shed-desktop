# Rust core (`shed-core`)

The shed-server protocol client — HTTP + SSE, control-token auth, TLS pinning,
and the wire DTOs — lives in a shared Rust core under `core/`, so the same logic
backs both the macOS Swift app and the **Tauri cross-platform client** (the shipped
Linux client) without being re-implemented per language. See `plans/phase-1-rust-core.md`
and `plans/phase-2-rust-clients.md` for the plans + panel reviews.

## Layout

A cargo workspace under `core/` (conventions mirror `../roost`) — its members
(`shed-core`, `shed-core-ffi`, `shed-app`, `shedctl`) are all default-members:

- **`shed-core`** — a *pure* Rust lib (no UniFFI): wire DTOs + serde decoders
  (`models.rs`), the reqwest(rustls) client (`http.rs`), the SSE parser
  (`sse.rs`), leaf-cert pinning (`tls.rs`), and the control-token FSM
  (`token.rs`), plus a `config` parser and a pull-based `create` orchestration
  store — and now **`rc.rs`** (pure Remote-Control: the pane classifier, the
  `shed-ext-rc` + non-interactive SSH argv builders, and the wire DTOs). The Linux
  clients (the Tauri app, `shedctl`) link this crate directly (no UniFFI).
- **`shed-core-ffi`** — a thin UniFFI wrapper (`crate-type = ["staticlib"]`)
  exposing a `ShedCore` object + records to Swift. `scripts/build-core.sh` builds
  it, runs `uniffi-bindgen`, and assembles a **static** `ShedCoreFFI.xcframework`
  linked into the app's Mach-O — no new dylib, so the release
  signing/notarization path is unaffected.
- **`shed-app`** — the UI-free app-logic layer (`Backend`), a workspace
  default-member; consumed by the Tauri client (as a cross-workspace path dep).
  Holds the **`RcRunner` portability seam** (`rc.rs`, behind the
  non-default `rc = ["tokio/process"]` feature) — the trait where a future mobile
  in-process-SSH runner replaces the desktop subprocess runner, so one
  `RcService` serves every frontend.
- **`shedctl`** — a headless UDS/IPC client shipped in the `.deb` alongside the Tauri
  `shed-desktop` binary, mirroring the macOS Swift `shedctl`. It *is* in `default-members`, so
  `make core-test`/`core-lint` cover it on the Mac.
- **Tauri client** — *not* a `core/` workspace member, but a consumer and the
  **shipped Linux client**: `tauri/src-tauri` is its own standalone cargo workspace
  that takes `shed-core` + `shed-app` as cross-workspace **path deps**. Its `[[bin]]`
  is **`shed-desktop-tauri`**, installed to `/usr/bin/shed-desktop` in the `.deb`
  (built via nfpm, `linux/scripts/build-deb.sh`). Runs on macOS (WKWebView, a
  UI-comparison loop vs the Swift app) and Linux (WebKitGTK, the shipped target) —
  see `plans/tauri-phase-{a,b,c}.md`.

`make core` builds it; `make build` / `make bundle` / CI build it before any
SwiftPM step (the `.binaryTarget` path must exist first). The generated artifacts
under `core/artifacts/` are gitignored.

## How the Swift app uses it

`ShedServerClient` (ShedKit) delegates to the core when `SHED_DESKTOP_RUST_CORE=1`
and otherwise keeps its existing `URLSession` path. `RustShedCoreAdapter` maps the
Rust records to the app's Swift `Models` (which double as the IPC wire shapes),
so every IPC op stays byte-unchanged. `identify` reports `core: rust|swift`.

The Rust core is the macOS **default** (Phase 2 M0); `SHED_DESKTOP_RUST_CORE=0`
forces the Swift path (a rollback escape hatch kept ≥2 releases). A per-host
adapter-construction failure fails **loudly** rather than silently downgrading. CI
runs the e2e suite on the default (rust) plus a `=0` Swift-fallback leg, and a
golden-JSON cross-backend byte-diff guards parity; `identify.core` reports which
backend is active.

## Invariants preserved (parity with the Swift client)

- **Defensive decoding**: `{"sheds": null}` → `[]`, omitted optionals, lenient
  `ShedStatus`, `"?"` name sentinels, and timestamps carried verbatim (parsing
  stays in Swift).
- **Auth, fail-closed**: a provider mint failure sends **no** token (never the
  static one — no secure-by-default downgrade); a 401 invalidates + retries once
  (provider-backed only); create mints once with no retry.
- **TLS**: leaf SHA-256 pin (`sha256:<lowercase-hex>`), fail-closed on a
  non-`https://` URL.
- **SSE create**: cross-chunk framing, and the `error` / stream-ended-without-
  `complete` terminal semantics.

## Building & testing

```bash
make core            # build the staticlib + regenerate the xcframework
make core-test       # cargo test the workspace
make core-lint       # cargo clippy -D warnings
make test            # swift tests (builds the core first)
SHED_DESKTOP_RUST_CORE=1 make e2e-ci   # the hermetic e2e with the Rust backend
```

Rust changes need `cargo`/`rustup` (the workspace pins the channel in
`core/rust-toolchain.toml`).

## Status & scope

Phase 1 (this core) covers the read client, lifecycle, SSE create, TLS pinning,
and the control-token FSM. Phase 2 (done) made it the macOS default (with a
golden-JSON cross-backend byte-diff + a size/cold-launch budget), got `shed-core`
building/testing on **Linux**, and hoisted the create orchestration + a `config` parser
into it. Phase 3 (done) first shipped a Linux `.deb` via `charliek/apt-charliek`
(`apt install shed-desktop`) with a bundled `shedctl` and unified the macOS + Linux
functional suites into one `tools/shedtest` harness; the release pipeline is
`create-release → mac + linux → apt-charliek dispatch` (see `RELEASING.md`). The
**Tauri cross-platform client** (`tauri/`), built on `shed-core` + `shed-app`, then
took over as the **shipped Linux client** — the earlier GTK MVP has been retired and
the `.deb` is now built from `tauri/src-tauri` (WebKitGTK). It carries lifecycle +
create, the approval spine (polkit gate + zbus notifier on Linux, Touch-ID on macOS),
the Agents/RC pane, tray/native-menu, and launch-at-login, driven by the
`tools/shedtest --target mac|tauri` harness. Deferred to `plans/phase-4-rust-core-only.md`:
retiring the Swift `URLSession` path + unifying config via the FFI. Still deferred:
absorbing/rewriting the credential broker in Rust (the final consolidation). See
`plans/tauri-phase-{a,b,c}.md`.
