"""Image model adoption (shed v0.6.0): the image_digest badge + the picker.

Covers, end to end against the hermetic mock:
  - `images.list` surfaces the enriched `GET /api/images` (alias / is_default
    / cached), which the New-Shed picker renders.
  - a default-image shed (only `image_digest`, no `image`) still round-trips
    its digest over IPC — the regression this change fixes.
  - the picker's chosen alias reaches the create request and the new shed.
  - `ui.show_create` presents the sheet so the picker is screenshot-driveable.
