// swift-tools-version: 6.0
//
// shed-desktop — a native macOS menu-bar control surface for the shed
// toolchain. Pure Swift (no C targets, no external deps for M0–M2):
// SwiftUI `MenuBarExtra` + `WindowGroup` for the UI, an in-process
// Unix-domain-socket JSON IPC server for drivability/testing, and
// `URLSession` for talking to shed-server over HTTP/SSE.
//
// The core/UI split (ShedKit vs ShedDesktopUI/ShedDesktopApp) keeps all
// I/O and logic unit-testable without a running UI, and is the seam a
// future Linux port would cut along. `shedctl` is a second executable —
// the CLI driver for the same IPC socket the pytest harness speaks.
